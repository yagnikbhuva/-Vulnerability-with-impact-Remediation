Host header
Prevention:
To prevent Host Header Injection attacks, it is important to follow secure coding practices and configure your web server to use strict parsing rules and ignore unexpected Host header values. Here are some specific prevention techniques:
1.Validate user input: Validate user input to ensure that it contains only expected characters and patterns. For example, you can use regular expressions to validate the Host header value.

2.Use a whitelist approach: Use a whitelist approach to validate input instead of a blacklist approach. This means that you should only allow known good values instead of trying to block known bad values.

3.Set the Host header value explicitly: Always set the Host header value explicitly in your code instead of relying on the user to provide it. This can help prevent attackers from injecting malicious values.

Impact:
The impact of Host header injection can vary depending on the specific vulnerability and the security context, but here’s a summary of potential impacts:

1. Cache Poisoning: Host header injection can manipulate caching mechanisms, leading to cache poisoning and the serving of malicious content to users.

2. Password Reset Poisoning: Attackers can exploit host header injection to manipulate the password reset process, potentially intercepting or manipulating reset emails, leading to unauthorized account access.

3. Phishing: Attackers can use this vulnerability to set up phishing attacks, tricking users into visiting malicious websites that appear legitimate.

4. Data Leakage: Host header injection can lead to the exposure of sensitive information, such as session cookies or user data, from a different domain or application.

5. Bypassing Security Controls: Attackers can use host header injection to bypass security controls, such as same-origin policies, potentially leading to unauthorized access to resources.

6. Website Defacement: In some cases, attackers may deface websites by injecting malicious content through the host header, damaging the site’s reputation and integrity.

CORS

IMPACT
Attackers can trick users into clicking on malicious links that will redirect to a vulnerable website. The attacker's page can then use JavaScript to perform unauthorized cross-origin requests from the victim's browser.

RECOMMENDATION 
Add CORS headers to allow cross-origin requests from only trusted sites..
Access-Control-Allow-Origin header should only be sites that are trusted and avoid using Wildcard (*) 
Set Access-Control-Allow-Credentials to true only when necessary.

CSP header
IMPACT
Attackers can exploit the absence of a Content Security Policy (CSP) header to inject malicious scripts into a website, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks 
RECOMMENDATION 
Implement Properly Content-Security-Policy Header


CLICKJACKING

IMPACT
Attackers can trick users into unknowingly clicking on malicious elements, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data theft on websites
RECOMMENDATION 
Add below Headers:
X-Frame-Options
Content Security Policy (CSP)


sensitive info in plain text 
IMPACT
If the input from the users received are of plain text, it will become easier for hackers to bypass and change the contents in the input by just using any intercepting tools. This also lets hackers get the user input details.
RECOMMENDATION 
Use Cryptography Mechanism because all sensitive data should be in strong encrypted form.


outdated jquery 
IMPACT
Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in outdated jQuery to execute malicious code, steal sensitive data, launch cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and compromise the security of web applications.
RECOMMENDATION 
The best solution is to upgrade your jQuery version to the latest and stable version.

Outdated booststrap 
IMPACT
Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in vulnerable and outdated Bootstrap versions to perform attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS), remote code execution, or data breaches, compromising the security and functionality of websites built with Bootstrap

RECOMMENDATION 
The best solution is to upgrade your Bootstrap version to the latest and stable version.






secure flag not set 
IMPACT
 Without the "Secure" flag on cookies, Attackers can sneakily grab your personal info when you're online, like your passwords or what you're doing, making your online activities less safe and private.
RECOMMENDATION 
The secure flag should be set on all cookies that are used for transmitting sensitive data when accessing content over HTTPS. 


cookie path set to /
IMPACT
If the cookie path is set to the root directory ("/"), the cookie will be accessible from any page on the same domain. Attackers can use it to perform actions on the user's behalf across the entire website. For example, they could use the cookie to access the user's account, modify data, or perform other malicious activities.

RECOMMENDATION 
Set the cookie path to a specific directory: By setting the cookie path to a specific directory of the web application, web developers can limit the scope of the cookie and prevent it from being accessible from other pages or applications on the same domain. 







Http flag noyt set 
IMPACT
If the HttpOnly flag is not set, then sensitive information stored in the cookie may be exposed to unintended parties. If the cookie in question is an authentication cookie, then not setting the HttpOnly flag may allow an adversary to steal authentication data (e.g., a session ID) and assume the identity of the user.
RECOMMENDATION 
Make sure the application sets the "HttpOnly" flag on sensitive cookies, which will help protect against data theft by hackers



improper input validation

Analysis:
The application is not validating  input and accepting all the special characters

IMPACT
Attackers can exploit improper input validation vulnerabilities to inject malicious data, potentially leading to actions like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or buffer overflows, which can compromise the security and integrity of a system, steal sensitive data, or execute unauthorized code

RECOMMENDATION 
Implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques.

Field level encryption
IMPACT
 Username and Password are clearly visible in plain text. The lack of field-level encryption in the web application exposes sensitive data, allowing potential attackers to intercept and manipulate specific data fields

RECOMMENDATION 
Use Cryptography Mechanism because all sensitive data should be in strong encrypted form.



server version discloser
IMPACT
This information can help an attacker gain a greater understanding of the systems in use and potentially develop further attacks targeted at the specific version of Microsoft IIS.

RECOMMENDATION 
The best solution is some useful and sensitive content must be hidden.


Improper Error Handling
IMPACT
This can help the attacker understand specifics.
about the web applications and possibly narrow down the attack surface.

RECOMMENDATION 
Finding and replacing these error handlers with more secure approaches. Each error should be customized in such a way that it does not reveal any web application related information.



Open ports 
IMPACT
Attackers can exploit open ports to gain unauthorized access, launch various types of attacks (e.g., brute-force attacks, malware distribution), steal sensitive data, disrupt services, or compromise the security and integrity of your computer or network.

RECOMMENDATION  
Close all the Unnecessary ports.



stack trace error
IMPACT
Attackers can potentially use information from a stack trace error to identify vulnerabilities, craft targeted attacks, and exploit weaknesses in your application or system's security

RECOMMENDATION 
It's recommended to handle exceptions internally and do not display errors containing sensitive information to a user.
Configure your web server, limit error details in production, implement robust error handling, keep software updated.


Rate Limit in passwor dfield
IMPACT
Attackers can try to brute force an account password. If a user forgets to logout account in some public computer, then attacker can know the correct password, and able to change the password to new one by inputting large number of payloads.
RECOMMENDATION 
Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms for login attempts to determine and mitigate such attacks.


user enumeration
Impact
Username enumeration will allow the Attackers to target specific accounts for unauthorized access or attacks

Recommendation 
Don’t throw error that the account is “invalid” is the common recommendation
and other recommendation is to return identical responses for “valid user/wrong password” and “invalid user” login requests.


CSP Bypass

IMPACT
Content Security Policy or CSP is a built-in browser technology which helps protect from attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS). It lists and describes paths and sources, from which the browser can safely load resources. The resources may include images, frames, javascript and more. 
RECOMMENDATION 
Implement Properly Content-Security-Policy Header


Connection not secure 

IMPACT
"Connection Not Secure" will makes your online interactions and data accessible to unauthorized users, increasing the risk of data theft, privacy breaches, and online threats like hacking or phishing
RECOMMENDATION 
To fix the not secure warning you need to purchase and properly install a secure sockets layer (SSL certificate) to move to secure site status and go from http to https.


Expired SSL certificate
IMPACT
Attackers can intercept and manipulate data transmitted between users and a website with an expired SSL certificate, leading to data theft, eavesdropping, and man-in-the-middle attacks, compromising user security and privacy.
RECOMMENDATION 
To mitigate the impacts of an expired SSL certificate, it's important to ensure that certificates are renewed or replaced before they expire.
